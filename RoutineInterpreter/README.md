# Routine Interpreter

## What this does:

This routine interpreter will take a configuration file and turn it into a watering routine.

Also, it outputs logs into logs.txt, and removes logs every hour, or to whatever schedule you set when adding the cron job. This does not configure cron itself, you have to do that yourself.
